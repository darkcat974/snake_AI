- AI to control the snake 🤖
- Adjustable game speed
- Simple and intuitive interface

## Installation ⚙

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:darkcat974/snake_AI.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd snake_ai
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage 🎮

To start the game with AI:
```bash
python game.py -[p|a]
```

To play the game manually:
```bash
python game.py
```

## AI Algorithm 🤖

The AI uses advanced machine learning techniques to navigate the snake and maximize the score. The main components include:
